# TaskBoard — Internship Final Project

**What it is**
TaskBoard is a lightweight Kanban-style task manager built using **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It demonstrates front-end skills you might show at the end of an internship: a responsive layout, DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop, and persistent state via `localStorage`.

**Features**
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Drag & drop tasks between columns (To Do / In Progress / Done).
- Persistence using `localStorage`.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Clean, well-commented source code for reviewers.

**Files**
```
/index.html       -> Main app
/styles.css      -> Styles (responsive)
 /script.js      -> App logic (add/edit/delete, drag & drop, storage)
 /README.md      -> This file
```

**How to run**
1. Unzip the project (if you downloaded the zip).
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Start adding tasks — they are saved automatically to your browser.

**Notes for reviewers**
- No build tools required.
- All state is stored locally; to reset storage click the "Reset" button in the header.
- You can use this app as a starting point: add authentication, back-end sync, or more advanced sorting.

**Possible extensions**
- User authentication + server sync (REST / GraphQL).
- Rich text for tasks, due dates, labels, and filters.
- Multi-user collaboration and real-time updates.

Good luck with your internship submission! If you want, I can:
- Add a PDF demo or slides.
- Convert this to a React single-file app.
- Include automated tests or GitHub Actions.
